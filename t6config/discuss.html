			I had seen a LOT of forums online, complaining about the 
connectibility or lack thereof, of the USB programming cable for the 
FS-CT6A radio. It seems that the PL-2303 USB chip used in the cable is 
not Windows friendly, and basically connect to Windows by sheer 
luck&nbsp; &gt;:(<br><br>After a LOT of researching and trial and error,
 I fould a $4 solution!!!&nbsp; ;D ;D ;D<br><br>On XHeli.com, they sell 
whats called a "computer simulator cable" in their flight sim section. 
It is a 4-pin to serial cable, which connects your radio to the PC using
 a serial port. NO USB DRIVER NEEDED! I use it and it works great.&nbsp;
 ;D<br><br>As a word of advice, if you want to use a USB connection (if 
your PC has no serial ports), uses this $4 serial cable with a separate 
USB-to-serial adapter. Avoid using a USB adapter which uses the 
"PL-2303" USB adapter chip. This cheap Taiwanese USB device chip is very
 unstable, and rarely connects with Windows due to crazy weak 
compatibility drivers.&nbsp; &gt;:(&nbsp; Find a USB-to-serial adapter 
that uses a different chip.<br><br>

			The Transmitter does use serial and that cable supplied as you say is
 just a serial to USB cable.<br><br>Usually the computer simulator 
cables are PWM (buddy port) to RS232 serial cables.<br>Have you actually
 gotten the cable you are talking about working w/ the T6config.exe 
software yourself?<br><br>I'm an Electrical Engineer and I know alot 
about both the PWM buddy port for radios as well as Serial and RS232 so 
I'm wondering if this is a suggestion or have you actually done this 
before others try this.<br><br>There is a thread on another forum about 
getting the prolithic driver to work in windows by placing a file on the
 PC. I know the trick to ANY usb device is to follow the instructions 
explicitly. Unfortunatly, the blueray did not come w/ the Tx manual on 
the disk so many people are plugging in the USB cable BEFORE installing 
the prolithic driver. You should install the prolithic driver FIRST, 
then plug in the cable. <br><br>David

			Here is the info that some have used to getting the prolithic driver 
working which I had previously posted on the blueray support thread:<br><br>If
 you have the RTF version here is the pocedure for using the 
t6config.exe program and driver:<br><br>&nbsp; Install the USB driver 
first. (PL-2303 Driver Install.exe)<br>&nbsp; Install the t6config.exe 
program next.<br>&nbsp; Plug the USB cable into the Computer.<br>&nbsp; 
Click through the hardware detection screens.<br>&nbsp; After the USB 
hardware detection screens, turn on the power to the Tx (did you install
 batteries?)<br>&nbsp; run T6config.exe<br>&nbsp; Click the "Setting" 
button to select the serial port that was created by the USB install 
(likely the last on the list).<br><br>&nbsp; If it is communicating, 
you'll see that moving your sticks make the green/black bars at the top 
move.<br>&nbsp; Click "Get User" to get the Tx setup loaded into your 
PC.<br>&nbsp; Click "Save" to save your settings (do this before you 
make changes so you have your defaults saved).<br><br>&nbsp; Note: Do 
not edit or save your config files without the Tx plugged in and 
communicating. I have found at least on my system, if I do this, it does
 not always save the data right if you work w/ T6config.exe when the 
transmitter is not plugged in and communicating w/ the PC.<br><br>I did 
not have any issues w/ installing my USB driver.<br>I installed the 
driver BEFORE plugging in the USB device.<br>But if you do, I heard this
 helps.<br>Download the MS Windows serial USB system file, called 
"ser2pl.sys" from here:<br><br>http://www.floridaprobe.com/usb_install.htm<br><br>The
 cable uses the Prolific PL-2303 USB chip. Apparently it doesn't always 
get recognized by Windows, so the system file doesn't get installed 
correctly.<br><br>Download the system file, and copy the file to your 
C:\Windows\System32 folder.<br>Plug in the USB cable into your computer,
 then restart your computer with it plugged in. It "should" get 
recognized at startup.

			Most of the time USB device doesn't work is because of software issue
 already existed on your current computer just like the USB simulator 
may not work on other computers.<br><br>If the USB cable works on my 
computer that means the device is a good device. You should windows 
update and install the intel's latest chipset driver.<br><br>Andy
