FMS Flight Simulator with CT6A Remote Control Transmitter – or T6A TX
======================================================================

FS-CT6A is a popular 6-channel RC TX, and is also a fabulous device to run 
a flight simulator on your home computer to get you trained before flying 
and crashing your real model plane. Here is the recipe. 

FMS: Get this freeware simulator. You can run it on a Windows inside 
a virtual machine if you use Linux. Both the 2.0 beta7 and 2.0 alpha8.5 
should work. The alpha8.5 crashes more often on my setup.

PPJoy: This is a virtual joystick simulation software driver for windows. 
Get it and install. It creates virtual joysticks on a windows machine 
without a real joystick hardware.

T6sim: It’s a bridging software that receives inputs from your CT6A and 
feed it to PPJoy. Get this software zip package and unzip it.

Follow the instructions in the install.txt file in t6sim package directory. 
In PPJoy *create a virtual joystick*. You may need to *reboot* windows at 
this point. *Run T6sim.exe*, it will be minimized into the system tray. 
Right click on the systray icon to *configure t6sim*. Then *calibrate t6sim*, 
*calibrate PPJoy*, and *calibrate Windows game device* so that the CT6A TX 
sticks generate full range of actions in all the softwares. All the 
instructions are in the install.txt file from t6sim package, do follow it. 
Only one tip, when configuring Windows game device, choose test mode and 
show raw data, then move the sticks on your TX you should see the raw data 
changing between 0 and 120. If you see the data fixed at a big number, 
go back to verify configurations and calibrations in t6sim and PPJoy.

It a good idea to also program your TX to use the configuration coming 
with t6sim. See my previous post about how to program it. Get and save 
your previous configuration from the TX to a file, then load the 
T6_calibration.cfg in t6sim package and send it to your TX. This 
configuration sets all the sticks to their simple mode.

Now, start FMS, you’ll get trained before crashing your real model! Get 
trained on simulator is a vital step or else you’ll crash your real model 
a lot.

All the software mentioned above is collected at a github repository. 
To download a specific file, you click on the file, then click raw it 
should ask you to save the file.
